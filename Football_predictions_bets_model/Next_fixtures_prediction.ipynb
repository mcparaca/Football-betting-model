    "# Predicting Next Fixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated to forecasting the outcomes of upcoming fixtures involving teams that have not yet played their matches. By utilizing the data we have collected and processed in previous notebooks, we can predict the expected goals for each team based on their current statistics and historical performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utilizing Current Data**: We will leverage the most recent datasets, which contain updated features such as historical match statistics, team form, and head-to-head (H2H) data, to make informed predictions about upcoming matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predicting Expected Goals**: The focus will be on estimating the expected goals (xG) for each team in the fixtures. This metric is crucial for evaluating a team's attacking and defensive capabilities and provides a clearer picture of potential match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Application**: We will apply the trained machine learning model developed in previous sections to predict the goals for each team. By inputting the relevant features into the model, we can generate predictions for both home and away teams in each fixture.\n",
